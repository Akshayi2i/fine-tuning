"""The RunPod Serverless handler (SPEC_11 §1, arch §14).

A persistent endpoint, unlike the ephemeral training pods: it is updated to a
promoted version and rolled back, not launched and destroyed.

Everything here is a thin shell around :func:`serving.pipeline.extract` and the
SPEC_07 inference core, so a served response is byte-for-byte what eval and the
testing harness produce for the same input. Generation logic in this file would
be a second implementation, and the numbers in the registry would then describe
the wrong one.

Three guards live here rather than deeper down, because this is the boundary
where a request enters the system:

**The MinerU pin is asserted at startup, not per request.** The model learned how
MinerU formats its output; serving OCR from a different version — or a different
*device*, if the Phase 0 spike shows the output differs — is the distribution
shift arch §8a exists to catch. A mismatch fails the cold start rather than
degrading quietly across every request afterwards.

**Missing calibration raises.** Returning raw logprob confidence when no
calibration exists for the served version would hand downstream review routing
numbers that look like probabilities and are not.

**Nothing plaintext reaches the logs, and no raw body is persisted.** Insurance
documents carry names, TINs, addresses and financials; a handler that logs its
request for debugging has exported all of it (master §8).
