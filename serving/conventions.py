"""A served common-model answer held to the conventions its labels follow
(accuracy plan, stage 4).

The training labels are corrected by ``data_pipeline.ingestion.label_rules``: a
value once, in its field, listing every page that prints it; extra fields only
for values with no field of their own; a unit's number only where it is
printed. A window answer cannot follow the first rule alone - it sees only its
own pages - and the model slips on the others. So the merged answer goes
through the SAME rules, against the document's page text, and what training
taught and what is served are one convention.

What differs from the labels is what happens to a value no page prints. A label
lists it and its windows are left out of training; a served answer flags it for
review (``<path>:not_printed``), and drops it only when it is an extra field of
a born-digital document whose page text settles it - nothing the document
prints is lost that way, and a value invented into the long tail is not served.
A scan's OCR text settles nothing (it misreads), so on a scan every value stays,
as do values on pages whose text lacks the answer's own figures (amounts drawn
in a font that records no characters).
