"""Document-type classification (arch §4a, §4b, §4c).

**Load-bearing, not preprocessing.** A wrong answer loads the wrong adapter *and*
the wrong prompt *and* the wrong schema, and the extraction fails regardless of
how good the model is. A classifier at 92% caps the whole system at 92%, which is
why it carries its own accuracy target and its own gating metric.

Two-level by necessity (arch §4b): type, then ACORD form number. One shared ACORD
adapter covers forms 25/125/140, but each form has a distinct schema, so the form
still has to be identified.

Default implementation is **zero-shot via the model already loaded** (arch §4a
Option C) — no extra model to train, serve, version, or keep in sync. The
interface is swappable for a dedicated vision classifier, which is the right
escalation if classification becomes a *measured* bottleneck, because it works in
both OCR and image-only modes.

On day zero this runs against the **base** model (arch §4c). That path is
explicitly temporary and retires when Foundation v1.0 is promoted.
