"""The request pipeline — the canonical extraction path (IMPL-11).

Every extraction goes through here: production requests and the testing harness
alike. **The harness calls this function; it does not reimplement it.** That is
the whole basis of "test == prod" — two code paths would be two systems, and the
tests would describe the wrong one.

    OCR (if provided)
      -> classify document type (+ ACORD form)
      -> route adapter / prompt / schema
      -> page-route if the document is long
      -> generate with logprobs
      -> per-field confidence, calibrated
      -> list-completeness cross-check
      -> validate against the schema
      -> JSON + confidence + review flags

The schema validation at the end mirrors the Fideon SPEC_07 Stage 3 audit gate: a
schema-invalid response is an **error**, not a returned result.
