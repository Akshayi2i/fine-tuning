"""Loading a model version and generating from it — the shared primitive.

Evaluation (IMPL-08), calibration (IMPL-09), serving (IMPL-11) and testing
(IMPL-12) all run the model through here. Building it once, below all four, is
what breaks the dependency cycle they would otherwise form, and what makes
"test == prod" a property of the code rather than a discipline.

Scope is deliberately narrow: **resolve a version, generate, return text and
logprobs.** No confidence calibration, no document-type classification, no
adapter routing — those are higher-level concerns that import this module, never
the other way round.

Backends are swappable (vLLM for serving, HF for local eval, GGUF for the
portable path) behind one interface, so the same calls work everywhere. Logprobs
are mandatory-capable: a backend that cannot return them cannot support the
confidence signal the whole pipeline depends on (arch §5).
