"""Message assembly — the single place prompt, images, and OCR come together.

Corpus build (SPEC_05), evaluation (SPEC_08), serving (SPEC_11) and testing
(SPEC_12) all call :func:`build_messages`. There is deliberately no second path,
because four contexts assembling their own inputs is how "test == prod" quietly
stops being true.

What this module guarantees:

* the system prompt is rendered by ``common.prompts`` and nothing else;
* ``image_only`` omits the OCR block *and* uses the image-only prompt, so the
  absence is declared rather than silently implied (arch §6);
* page images stay **ordered**, because multi-page ordering is positionally
  meaningful under Interleaved-MRoPE (arch §3);
* each page's image is **immediately followed by that page's own OCR text**, so
  which text belongs to which image is positional rather than something the
  model has to infer. Concatenating the pages into one block destroyed that
  correspondence, and — because a blank line ends a Markdown table — split every
  table that crossed a page boundary into two, the second half without its
  header;
* a routed subset of pages is the **same structure with fewer pairs**, so a long
  policy is served in a shape the model actually trained on;
* the resolution cap comes from config and matches the cap the corpus was built
  with — asserted, not assumed (arch §11).

            joining is what destroyed the page correspondence and split every

        modality_mode: one of :data:`common.constants.MODALITY_MODES`.
        acord_form: required for ACORD — selects the schema (arch §4b).

        sections: the slice of that schema one window asks for — ``decl``,

        assistant_content: the golden JSON, when building a *training* row.
            Omitted at inference, where the assistant turn is what gets generated.
        check_resolution_parity: assert the training and serving caps agree.
        page_numbers: the true page numbers of these images. Defaults to
            ``1..n``. A routed request passes the real numbers so the markers
            say ``<page 9 of 20>`` rather than mislabelling page 9 as page 2.
        total_pages: pages in the whole document. Defaults to the number given,
