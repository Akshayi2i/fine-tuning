"""Fixes for the pinned vLLM, applied where the engine is built.

**Qwen3-VL LoRA over the vision tower (vLLM 0.11.0).** vLLM puts LoRA on the
language model only: it skips every module whose name starts with the model's
``get_mm_mapping()`` tower and connector prefixes. 0.11.0's Qwen3-VL returns
``model.visual.`` for them, the checkpoint's name, while the engine's own modules
are named ``visual.`` (its weight mapper renames them). Nothing matches, the
vision tower's linears are wrapped as LoRA layers, and the first request with an
image fails in ``_lora_shrink``: ``assert token_lora_mapping.size(0) == M`` -
the tower sees image patches, the mapping counts prompt tokens. Text-only
requests never reach the tower, which is how it passed the Phase 0 spike.
0.11.1 corrects the prefixes to ``visual.``; it also moves to torch 2.9, which
the training environment is pinned against, so the correction is applied here.

The engine core must run in this process for a patch here to reach it: vLLM V1
otherwise starts it in a child process, which is spawned (and so re-imports vLLM
unpatched) whenever CUDA is already initialised in the parent.
