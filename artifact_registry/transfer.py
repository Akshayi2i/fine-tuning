"""Path-aware push/pull helpers (SPEC_02 §3).

``BlobClient`` moves bytes; ``paths`` says where they go. This module is the join:
one named function per artifact class, so **no caller ever hand-builds a Blob
path**.

That is not tidiness. Every path a caller assembles inline is a place the layout
can be got wrong silently — and it was: ``stage_push`` built its own destinations
and published a Foundation run against the ``doc_type=None`` "unified" merged and
quantized paths, which only exist under ``--foundation-only``. The manifest then
pointed at artifacts nobody had built. A named ``push_merged_model(doc_type=...)``
makes that mistake impossible to express.

Split by direction for readability, but kept in one module because a push and its
pull must agree on the path, and two files are two places for them to drift.
