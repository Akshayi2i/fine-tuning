"""Blob and staging-volume layout — expressed once, here.

Every path in the system is built through this module. The layout appearing in
two places is how a training job ends up writing where a serving job will never
look, so nothing else constructs a path by string concatenation.

Two storage surfaces with **different guarantees**, and conflating them is the
bug this module's naming exists to prevent:

Azure Blob
    The artifact of record. Durable, versioned, and where the run registry lives.

RunPod staging volume
    Working storage between ``finetune`` (command 1) and ``package`` (command 2).
    Adapters and the ~16GB merged model sit here so quantization — which also
    runs on RunPod — does not pull them back out of Azure, a 32GB round trip for
    nothing. **No durability guarantee.** It is never called a registry
    (master §12a).

Tenancy (arch §8b): the ``tenant_id`` prefix is *reserved* on every path holding
tenant document data, so no migration is needed when a second broker arrives.
The build is single-tenant — ``tenant_id`` defaults from ``DEFAULT_TENANT_ID``
rather than being a required argument everywhere. The one rule that is live and
enforced is that a corpus file must never mix tenants, because corpus
composition is training data.

#: ``releases`` is here because **a model trained on a tenant's documents is that
#: tenant's data** (arch v2.1 §8b) — a deletion request that stops at the corpus

#: than being scattered into the v1 ``eval-reports/`` and ``calibration/`` trees:

#: beneath them would make ``tenant_of`` read a version tag as a tenant id.
#:
#: ``golden-eval-set`` is here because each tenant is gated on its own frozen
#: set. The set is copied from one tenant's test split, so it holds that tenant's
#: documents; and source ids are numbered per tenant, so one shared prefix would
#: let the first tenant to freeze fix the yardstick for every tenant and make
#: another tenant's ``policy_0001`` look frozen. The whole prefix moved at once:
#: a set frozen at its root before this is refused until it is moved under its
#: tenant (``evaluation.freeze_eval_set``), so ``tenant_of`` never reads a source id.
