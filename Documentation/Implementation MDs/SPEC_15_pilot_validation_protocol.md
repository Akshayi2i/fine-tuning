# SPEC 15 — Pilot Validation Protocol (De-Risking Before Full Annotation)

> Read `SPEC_00_MASTER_CONTEXT.md` first. Dependencies: SPEC_01–SPEC_14 built.
>
> **This spec is executed, not imported.** It is an operational runbook, not a library — nothing else in the repo depends on it. It exists because architecture v1 added §16, which has no home in the module specs.
>
> **Architecture refs:** `finetuning-architecture-v2.1.docx` §16 (**pilot validation protocol**), §16a/§16b/§16c, §8 (pilot split ratios), §4c (day-zero bootstrap), §15 (metrics).

## Goal

Before committing to full corpus annotation, run three sequential experiments that de-risk the architecture in order of increasing investment. Each answers a different question, and each is cheap relative to the one after it.

**Run these in order. Do not skip to 16c.**

## Deliverables

### 1. `pilot/zero_shot_baseline.py` — Experiment A (Week 1, no annotation cost)

Run the **base, untuned** `Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct` against **10 real documents per document type**, using the SPEC_01 prompt template with the Fideon SPEC_00 schema injected. Compute field-level F1 against ground-truth annotations.

**Implement this as a thin wrapper over the existing extraction command**, not as a parallel path:

```bash
python -m orchestration.run extract --model base --input pilot/baseline_docs/ \
       --ground-truth pilot/baseline_golden/
```

SPEC_13's `--model base` and SPEC_02's `resolve_model_version("base")` exist precisely so the baseline, day-zero pre-annotation (SPEC_04), and this experiment all run the same code. A separate implementation here would measure something subtly different from what production runs.

This tells you how much the base model extracts for free and — more usefully — **where it fails**: schema adherence, list-row recall, LoB detection, or OCR arbitration.

**Outcome thresholds and what each means:**

| Zero-shot field F1 | Interpretation | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| **> 0.70** | Strong base-model prior; fine-tuning expected to reach production quality | Proceed to pilot corpus |
| **0.40 – 0.70** | Fine-tuning will materially improve; specific failure modes identified | Proceed, **with targeted corpus coverage for the weak areas** |
| **< 0.40** | Base model likely insufficient as framed | **Review prompt design, schema complexity, and document difficulty *before* committing annotation investment** |

- Output: `pilot/reports/zero_shot_baseline.json` — per-doc-type F1, per-metric breakdown (schema validity, list recall, LoB accuracy, OCR arbitration), and the failure-mode distribution.
- Uses SPEC_07 inference core and SPEC_08 metrics — the same code the production gate uses, so the numbers are comparable later.

### 2. `pilot/smoke_test.py` — Experiment B (Weeks 1–2, 5 annotated documents)

Annotate exactly **5 documents per document type**. Train to **intentional overfit**: no train/val split, 5 epochs, learning rate at the upper end of the sweep range.

**This proves the code pipeline is correct — not that the architecture generalises.** It is a sanity check, not a proof of concept.

Confirm all of:
- Training loss reaches **below 0.05 within 2 epochs**.
- The model reproduces the 5 training examples with **field F1 > 0.95 on the training set**.
- End-to-end, without error: the ms-swift training loop, the data collator, LoRA adapter loading, adapter save and push to Azure Blob, vLLM multi-adapter hot-swap, and run manifest generation.

**Why 5 documents and not 1:** a single source document generates only three modality variants (three training examples), which isn't enough to exercise the full data collator pipeline. Five documents per type covers multi-page, OCR-failure, and image-only edge cases.

- Output: `pilot/reports/smoke_test.json` — loss curve, train-set F1, and a pass/fail per pipeline component.
- **A failure here is a code bug, not an architecture problem.** Fix it before spending annotation budget.

### 3. Experiment C — Pilot Training Run (Weeks 2–6, 25–30 documents per type)

Annotate 25–30 documents per document type per SPEC_04, using the **pilot split ratios (~70/18/12)** from SPEC_05. Train ONE unified adapter with the §11.1 pilot hyperparameters. Evaluate on the pilot test split, in every modality regime.

This is the **minimum experiment that tests the architecture's generalisation claim**: whether one adapter captures cross-type behaviour without the types interfering, whether modality-dropout arbitration functions, whether totals reconciliation catches a missed row on unseen documents, and whether the per-field-type calibrators have enough data to be enforced at all — at pilot volume several field types will not clear the 300-instance floor and will route everything to review, which is the system working rather than failing.

**Pilot success criteria — directional targets, not production thresholds:**

| Metric | Pilot threshold |
|---|---|
| Field F1 (non-list fields) | > 0.80 |
| List-field recall | > 0.75 |
| JSON schema validity | 100% |
| Image-only field F1 | Within 15% of OCR-plus-image F1 |
| Row-completeness detection accuracy | > 80% of documents with missing rows flagged |
| LoB detection accuracy | > 0.85 |
| **Alias generalization** | Field accuracy on a **held-out surface label** within 15% of accuracy on that field's dominant label |
| **Confusable misattribution rate** | < 5% |

**A failed criterion signals a specific architectural issue to diagnose — not a reason to abandon the architecture.** Diagnose the failure-mode distribution, expand corpus coverage for the failing case, and re-run the pilot. Map each failure to its likely cause:

| Failed criterion | First place to look |
|---|---|
| Field F1 low | Prompt/schema design; corpus coverage for that doc type; LR/epochs on the unified run (a targeted retrain, not the deferred sweep) |
| List-field recall low | Loss Run corpus row-length variety; row-completeness signal (SPEC_09); consider list-specific prompt rules |
| Schema validity < 100% | Prompt rules (no fences, null-handling); JSON structural discipline in the Foundation corpus |
| Image-only F1 gap > 15% | **The ViT escalation gate (SPEC_06 `vit_gate`)** — but only if errors are perception-type, not schema/reasoning |
| Row-completeness misses | Cross-check sources in SPEC_09: is MinerU's table row count reaching the signal? |
| LoB accuracy low | **LoB corpus coverage (SPEC_05 `corpus_manifest`)** — check the ≥20%-per-value target before blaming the model |
| Alias generalization gap > 15% | **`alias_coverage` in the corpus manifest** — the held-out label is probably under-represented. Also check the field's semantic gloss: a vague `description` gives the model nothing to generalise from |
| Confusable misattribution ≥ 5% | **`confusable_example_count`** — near zero means the corpus taught the mapping but never the boundary. Also check the gloss carries an explicit exclusion clause (SPEC_01) |

**Alias generalization is measured by deliberate hold-out.** Pick one surface label per confusable-prone field (say, *Applicant* for `insured_name`), keep every document using it out of `train`, and place them in the pilot test split. If the model scores well on them it has learned the semantic mapping rather than memorising label strings — which is the whole claim of the canonical-field design (master §1.4) and the one thing no plumbing test can prove.

- Output: `pilot/reports/pilot_run.json` + a `pilot/pilot_report.py` summary that puts all three experiments side by side.

### 4. `pilot/pilot_report.py`
- Aggregates the three experiment reports into one human-readable go/no-go document: baseline → smoke → pilot, each with its thresholds, actuals, and pass/fail.
- States explicitly which criteria failed and the diagnosis path from the table above.
- **Every pilot training run still writes a normal `RunManifest`** (SPEC_02) — pilot runs are registry entries, not untracked experiments.
- **This is the gate the deferred work waits on.** The hyperparameter sweep (SPEC_06 `sweep.py`, arch §11a) runs *after* this protocol passes and *before* production-scale training — sweeping on 25–30 docs/type measures noise, not signal.

## Constraints
- Run the experiments **in order**; each gates the next.
- The pilot is not an exemption from the PII rules — but de-identification is currently **blocked** (SPEC_05 §1), so pilot data is protected by tenancy and access control only, and that must be acknowledged before real documents are used.
- Pilot eval numbers are **directional**. At 3–4 test documents per type, no single metric is trustworthy on its own; the batch's real job is proving the pipeline works end to end before scaling annotation to 1000+/type.
- Re-baseline properly once at real scale — do not carry pilot thresholds forward as production gates.
- Pilot documents inherit the **unresolved de-identification question** (SPEC_05 §1). Until it is resolved, pilot corpora are built without de-identification and that limitation is stated, not assumed away.

## Acceptance checklist
- [ ] `zero_shot_baseline` runs the base model over 10 docs/type and emits per-type F1 plus a failure-mode distribution.
- [ ] The baseline decision table produces the correct proceed/review recommendation on seeded scores.
- [ ] `smoke_test` trains to overfit on 5 docs/type and reports loss < 0.05 by epoch 2 and train F1 > 0.95.
- [ ] The smoke test exercises and reports pass/fail for every listed pipeline component, including Blob push and vLLM hot-swap.
- [ ] Pilot run evaluates against all six pilot criteria and names any that fail with its diagnosis path.
- [ ] Every pilot training run produces a `RunManifest`.
- [ ] `pilot_report` renders the three experiments as one go/no-go summary.

## Current implementation (2026-09-27)

- **Pilot split**: under 200 documents per type the band is 70/18/12, applied **per line of business**; a
  line with fewer than 5 documents trains whole and is not measured (listed in the manifest's
  `train_only_lines`). At pilot volume many lines fall below that — their pilot numbers do not exist, by
  design, rather than being noise.
- **Alias hold-out** (above) is still done by choosing documents deliberately; it is not automatic — the
  hash split does not know which surface label to hold out.
- **Freezing a pilot eval set** needs `freeze-eval-set --allow-small`: under 100 test documents per type the
  set is directional, and once frozen it is the yardstick for every later version. Prefer to freeze from the
  first build at real scale; if a pilot set is frozen, replacing it later is a deliberate delete-and-refreeze
  after which older scores are not comparable.
- **Pod runs**: every pilot command started on the pod runs detached in tmux (SPEC_13); install each pod with
  `bash scripts/setup_pod.sh <role>` and run `python scripts/phase0_spike.py` first.
