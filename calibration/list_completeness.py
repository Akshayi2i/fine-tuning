"""Row completeness — the signal token logprobs structurally cannot provide (arch §5).

The failure this exists for: the model extracts 6 of 8 claims. The 2 missing rows
**generate no tokens**, so there is no low probability anywhere to flag. Per-field
confidence on the 6 extracted rows can all be 0.95 while the extraction is
silently incomplete. It is a recall failure, and token confidence is blind to it
by construction — no amount of calibration fixes a signal that has no input.

So list fields carry **two** confidence signals, not one:

1. per-value confidence, from logprobs, for the fields inside each extracted row;
2. row completeness, from cross-checks against the document itself.

Two independent cross-checks, either of which flags the list:

* the **document's own stated count** — a "Total Claims: 3" field;
* the **structure-derived count** — table rows MinerU detected on the relevant
  pages, recorded in ``ocr_meta.json`` at OCR time.

When either disagrees with the extracted row count, the **whole list** is flagged
regardless of how confident the individual values are. This matters most on Loss
Runs, where a missed claim row is both easy to produce and expensive to miss.
