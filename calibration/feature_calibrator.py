"""Per-field-type feature calibrators (arch v2.1 §5.3).

A logistic regression per field type, over the §5.2 feature vector, fitted on the
**calibration half** of the validation split.

**Why per field type and not per field.** At pilot volume a per-field calibrator
would see a handful of instances each — an `insured_name` calibrator fitted on
twenty-five examples describes those twenty-five examples. Pooling by type gives
each calibrator hundreds of instances while keeping apart the things that
genuinely miscalibrate differently: an identifier is exact-match and unforgiving,
a free-text description is fuzzy and tolerant, and one curve cannot serve both.

**Why logistic regression and not isotonic, yet.** Isotonic is free-form and
needs data to avoid fitting noise; §5.3 puts its threshold at 2,000 labelled
instances per field type. Below that, a two-parameter-per-feature model is the
honest choice. The switch is a config change, not a rewrite.

**The floor that matters.** A field type with fewer than ``MIN_INSTANCES``
labelled instances gets **no calibrator**, and every field of that type routes to
review. Not a default curve, not the pooled one — review. A calibrator fitted on
forty instances produces numbers that look like probabilities and are not, and
the thresholds in §5.4 are defined against a calibrated score.

Gradient descent in pure Python. The design matrix is a few hundred rows by
eleven columns; scikit-learn would be faster and is already an `eval` extra, but
this keeps calibration runnable on the pod without pulling the eval stack in, and
the fit takes milliseconds.
