"""Confidence-routed review queue (SPEC_04 §6, arch §7 step 6, §13 stage 11).

Once a model version exists, calibrated confidence decides how much human
attention a document gets: high-confidence extractions get a light spot-check,
low-confidence *fields* get full manual review. That is what makes labeling cost
fall across corpus versions instead of staying flat.

Two design points carry most of the value:

**Per-field, not per-document.** Flagging a whole 40-row Loss Run because one
date was uncertain wastes the reviewer's time on 39 correct rows. The queue
carries the specific fields.

**Row-completeness overrides confidence entirely.** A Loss Run whose row count
disagrees with the document goes to full review even when every extracted value
scored 0.99 — because the missing rows have no confidence score at all. Their
absence is invisible to a logprob, which is exactly why SPEC_09 computes a
separate signal for it.

**Disabled while the review requirement is "full".** Before 25 labels per type
exist, confidence routing is routing on a model with no evidence it is
trustworthy (arch §4c). The refusal is a guard, not a warning.
