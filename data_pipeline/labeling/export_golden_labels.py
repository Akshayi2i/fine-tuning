"""Writing verified golden labels, with validation and provenance (SPEC_04).

A golden label is the training target. Everything the model learns about field
semantics comes from these, so admission is gated: a label that validates against
the schema but names the wrong entity trains the model to make that exact mistake
confidently.

Three checks run before anything is written:

1. **Schema conformance** against the canonical Fideon SPEC_00 schema (arch §0a).
2. **``line_of_business`` present**, a list of valid values or explicitly ``[]`` (arch §0b).
3. **``field_provenance`` names no registered confusable** — a label claiming
   ``insured_name`` was found under "Certificate Holder" is rejected. This is the
   highest-value annotation check in the system, because that mistake is exactly
   what teaches the model to conflate distinct parties.

The **day-zero rule** (arch §4c) also lives here rather than in its own module:
it is a counter and a threshold, and it belongs beside the thing it gates.
