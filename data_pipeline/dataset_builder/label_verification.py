"""A label value that a rule computed is trained on only if the page prints it.

Most of each synthetic label was not read off the page by anyone: it was added
from the source document's reviewed gold by ``fill_synthetic_labels`` - copied,
date-shifted, or mapped from a replaced value - and recorded under
``fideon:filled``. That is 205,922 values over 1,550 labels, about two thirds of
everything the labels state. ``ocr_check`` compares them with the page only as a
RATE (added fields found about as often as original ones), so a single computed
value the synthetic page does not print still reached the training target, and
the model was taught to write something it could not have read.

:func:`verified_label` checks each added value against the document's own OCR
text, with the audit's matching (``data_pipeline.audit``):

* printed on a page it cites - kept;
* printed on exactly one other page - kept, and it cites that page;
* printed nowhere, or only on several other pages - left out;
* shorter than the audit can check - kept, as the audit treats it.

Values a person or the generator placed (not under ``fideon:filled``) are never
touched: a value the OCR missed may still be on the image, and that is the
model's to read. With no OCR text at all nothing can be verified and the label
is returned as it is, with every added value counted as unverifiable.
