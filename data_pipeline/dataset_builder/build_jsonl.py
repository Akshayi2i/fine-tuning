"""Compile documents into chat-format JSONL training rows (IMPL-05, arch §6, §7).

Split first, expand second, inside whichever split the document was already
assigned to:

* **train** — one row per epoch, each in that epoch's sampled modality regime
  (arch v2.1 §6.1), written as ``train/epoch_1..4.jsonl``;
* **val / test** — three rows, one per regime, so image-only and noisy-OCR
  accuracy are measured on the full eval population.

The rows are built through :func:`inference_core.input_builder.build_training_row`,
which is the same function the serving path uses to assemble a request. That is
what makes the training prompt and the inference prompt provably identical rather
than identical by convention (arch §7).
