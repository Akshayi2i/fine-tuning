"""One document into many task examples (arch v2.1 §7b).

v1 had a single task: extract a whole document in one call. That does not survive
a forty-page policy or a dense Loss Run, and the v1 answer — route pages and ask
for a document-level JSON from each one — asked for a shape no training row ever
had.

v2.1 decomposes the work instead, and **trains one adapter on all of it**. The
task is declared in the prompt, so the model is never guessing which output shape
is wanted, and a routed request stays a subsequence of the full-document shape.

    ACORD      classify -> extract (all pages, one call)
    Policy     classify -> page_select -> extract (selected pages, one call)
    Loss Run   classify -> lossrun_header -> lossrun_rows (windows) ->
                           lossrun_totals -> deterministic merge

Every example a document produces shares that document's split, because they all
share its group (§8.2). Getting that wrong would leak a document's header into
train and its rows into test.

**The window planner is output-bound, not input-bound.** A Loss Run page holding
forty claim rows produces far more output than a page holding eight, and the
constraint that binds first is the reserved output budget — not the page images.
So the window shrinks as row density rises, and the planner checks its own
estimate against the budget before committing.
