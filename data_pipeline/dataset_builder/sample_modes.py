"""Per-document, per-epoch modality sampling (arch v2.1 §6.1).

**What v1 did and why it was wrong.** Each source document was expanded into
three rows — one per modality regime — and all three went into the corpus. That
had two consequences nobody intended:

* The realised mix was **33/33/33**, not the 50/20/30 the architecture specifies.
  A downstream sampler tried to correct it by discarding rows, which threw away
  labelled data to fix a shape problem.
* Every document was seen **three times per epoch**, so a "3 epoch" run was nine
  passes over the corpus. The epoch count in the manifest described something
  other than what ran, and the early-stopping patience was counted in the wrong
  unit.

**What happens instead.** Each source document appears **once per epoch**, and
its mode for that epoch is drawn from a seeded generator against the target mix.
Over three or four epochs a document is seen in two or three different regimes,
which is the modality-dropout behaviour the design wanted — without inflating the
epoch count or discarding anything.

The corpus materializes four epoch files regardless of how many a run uses
(§8.1), because the §11a epoch sweep tests up to four passes and a sweep that
regenerates its own data is not comparing what it thinks it is.
