"""How a policy is read: its windows, and each window's training target.

Every canonical policy — short or long — is read as the cross product of section
groups and page windows (``configs/schema_sections.yaml``): ``decl`` over the
declarations pages, ``arrays`` and ``lineblk`` over every routed page, ``dtd``
where the line carries it. Always, never above a length threshold: a threshold
computed from prompt length moves whenever the template, a schema or the vision
budget does, and would silently re-shape documents between two corpus builds.

**One planner, two callers.** :func:`plan_windows` is what the dataset build
expands a document with *and* what ``serving.pipeline`` extracts one with. It is
a function of the line, the routed pages and where the declarations were found —
never of a gold label — so the windows a model trains on are the windows it is
served. The routed pages come from the same place on both sides too:
``serving.page_router.plan_pages`` over the OCR text the row actually carries, or
every page when there is none.

**The target is the window's slice of the gold label** (:func:`window_target`):
the group's sections, narrowed to values printed on the window's own pages. A
value on a page the window was not shown is not in its target — asking the model
for it would teach it to invent. A row that spans a window boundary keeps the
fields each window can see, in both windows; the serving merge collapses the
halves. ``page_ref`` keeps the DOCUMENT's page numbers: the prompt's markers say
``<page 140 of 200>``, and a window-relative number would be wrong by an offset
nobody would notice - and only the window's own pages: a value printed on pages
1 and 30 is cited as ``[1]`` by the window showing page 1, which cannot see page
30 (Fideon SPEC_09 amendment item 1). The serving merge joins a value's pages
across windows again (``serving.policy_merge``).

Two sections are handled apart (Fideon SPEC_21): ``text_sections`` is never in
a target - the section builder attaches it at inference - and each
``additional_fields`` entry (label, value, section_hint, page_ref) is placed by
its own pages, as a field value is.

**A common-model line** (SPEC_21 overlays) links rows by id. Its ids, codes and
types are bare values no page prints, so they travel only with a row that keeps
a printed value on the window's pages, and only a printed value identifies a
row for the orphan rule; the target is narrowed to the window's own slice (a
reference to a table another group reads is not in it); and its ids are
renumbered from 1 in the window (common.structural_ids), so a window is taught
the ids it can see and never a reference to a row it is not shown. Its label
holds one part, of the line itself. Every finished target is checked against
the window's slice of the model view, the grammar its decoder is held to: a
target that grammar cannot write is refused, never taught.
