"""MinerU for one request, within a time budget (Fideon SPEC_05 §4).

The serving-side entry point. The caller passes the document's modality and
``force_ocr`` as its routing stage decided them; nothing is detected here. A
native document reads within ``NATIVE_TIMEOUT_S``; a scanned one, or a native
one forced through OCR because its figures are drawn (§4.1), within
``SCANNED_TIMEOUT_S`` - it is doing the scanned path's work. Past its budget,
or on any failure, the call raises :class:`MinerUError` and the document goes
to review (§9).

This repository's own serving endpoint runs no OCR: its requests arrive with
their page texts (``serving.vllm_entrypoint``). This is what produces them
where a PDF arrives instead.

**A timeout stops the wait, not MinerU.** The call runs in a worker thread, and
a thread cannot be interrupted: past its budget the request fails at once, but
MinerU finishes in the background and its result is dropped. A caller that
must reclaim the GPU at the deadline runs MinerU in a worker process.
