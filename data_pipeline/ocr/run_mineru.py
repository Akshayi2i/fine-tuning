"""MinerU OCR and page rendering, GPU-accelerated (arch §14, §8a).

Reads ``raw-documents/``, writes ``processed/``. Never writes back to the raw
layer, and nothing downstream of here touches raw documents again.

Two things are non-negotiable:

**The resolution cap comes from config and is recorded.** Image token count is a
direct function of page resolution — the single biggest cost and latency lever
(arch §11) — and the cap must be *identical* here and at production inference. A
mismatch means serving the model a distribution it never trained on, which shows
up only as degraded accuracy with no error anywhere.

**The MinerU version and device are recorded on every document.** The model
learns how MinerU formats its output, so both are part of the corpus pin
(:mod:`~data_pipeline.ocr.mineru_version`).

The MinerU invocation is deliberately behind a swappable interface: it may run as
a library call or a subprocess, and the Phase 0 spike may replace it outright.
