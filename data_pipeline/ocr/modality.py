"""Which reader a PDF needs: its modality, and whether its figures are drawn
(Fideon SPEC_05 §4 and §4.1).

Two modalities, three cases. A PDF is ``native_pdf`` when every page carries a
text layer and ``scanned_pdf`` otherwise - one page without one sends the whole
document through OCR, because text mode leaves a mixed document's scanned pages
unread. The third case is a native PDF whose figures are DRAWN as filled vector
outlines instead of typed: its text layer carries the headings but not the
numbers, so it is native and still needs OCR. That is ``force_ocr``, not a
second modality: the document is native, and everything downstream that keys
on modality should keep seeing it so (SPEC_05 §4.1).

In serving the caller knows both - the routing stage upstream decided them -
and passes them in. Only the offline tools, which have no upstream stage,
detect them here. Upstream, both come from SPEC_01's step 0, which is not in
this repository; these are this repository's own and the one place to swap
that function in.
