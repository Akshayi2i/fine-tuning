"""Turn a synthetic-data delivery into import bundles: one folder per document.

The generator (fideon_synth ``scripts/build_dataset.py``) delivers

    <input>/Train|Val|Test/pdfs/<name>.pdf
    <input>/Train|Val|Test/gold json/<name>.json
    <input>/manifest.csv      split, lob, carrier, source, sample, kind, pdf, gold, ok, ...

and the importer and the audit read one folder per document:

    <out>/<name>/document.pdf, golden.json, metadata.json

``metadata.json`` is written from the manifest row, nothing guessed:

    lob          the line, which selects the canonical schema
    synthetic    true for a generated twin, false for the source itself
    template_id  the source document it was made from - the family the delivery
                 was split by, so a source and its twins stay on one side
    split        the delivery's own train/val/test, which the corpus build then
                 uses as given (split_groups.assign_delivered_splits)

Rows outside the scope's lines (flood, for personal_lines), rows the generator
flagged (``ok`` false) and rows whose files are missing are skipped and counted.

    python -m data_pipeline.ingestion.prepare_bundles --input "data/training data" --out data/bundles

Files are hard-linked by default: instant, and no second copy of 16 GB on the
same drive. Where a link is impossible (another drive) they are copied.

Documents the audit rejected are listed in an exclusion file (``--exclude``,
default ``data/bundle_exclusions.csv``: ``document,reason``), so a re-run keeps
them out - and removes their folders if an earlier run made them - instead of
the fix living only in a folder someone deleted by hand.

**A SPEC_21 delivery** (``split_manifest.csv``: split, lob, carrier, seed, twin,
digital, scanned, gold) delivers each twin twice - a digital PDF and a scanned
rendering of it - with one gold. Each render becomes a document of its own
(``render_mode`` digital or scanned, ``sample`` the twin's number, the seed as
the family), both reading one gold - one document when the two are the same
file, as a scanned seed's twins are. The gold the bundles hold is corrected
where the delivered one cannot be trained on as it is (:func:`corrected_gold`),
each change listed in ``<out>/corrections.csv``; the delivery is never changed
(a corrected gold is written as a new file, never through a hard link to the
delivered one). A gold still outside its line's schema after that is left out,
with the reason. ``--dry-run`` reports all of it and writes nothing.

A re-run leaves ``<out>`` holding exactly what it bundles of the delivery: a
folder an earlier run made for a document this run leaves out (its gold, its
files, its line, ``--originals none``) is removed, and ``corrections.csv`` is
rewritten. Folders of other deliveries are not touched.

**The seeds themselves** - the real documents the twins were made from - are
delivered apart (``--originals``, default ``data/source data``: ``pdfs/`` and
``gold json/``, ``<line>/<carrier>/<seed>.pdf`` and ``<seed>.gold.json``). Each
becomes a real document (``synthetic`` false) in its twins' family and split,
read from the twins' manifest, so a seed and its twins are never on two sides;
its gold gets the same corrections.

**Real documents alone** - no twins, no manifest, no split - of one line
(``--lob``), laid out as ``<input>/PDFs/<carrier>/<name>.pdf`` with
``<input>/Gold JSON/<carrier>/<name>.gold.json`` (the CGL source data):

    python -m data_pipeline.ingestion.prepare_bundles --input "data/CGL source data" --lob gl \\
        --scope casualty_fleet --out data/cgl_bundles

Each pair becomes ``<line>__<carrier>__<name>``, its gold corrected as above. A
family is one insured: a declarations page, the policy and its renewals stay on
one side. The split is drawn as the corpus build draws one
(:func:`~data_pipeline.dataset_builder.split_groups.assign_group_splits`) and
delivered in the metadata, so it is the same on every re-run and a smoke batch
can be drawn from it; ``<out>/split.csv`` lists it for review.
