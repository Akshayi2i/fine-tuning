"""Label rules applied as a bundle is prepared (accuracy plan, stage 1).

The delivered golds were drafted, not reviewed, and disagree with each other:
extra fields run from 1 to 221 rows per document and repeat values that have
their own field, a location number is written as "1" or taken from a street
address, page lists miss pages or name pages that do not print the value. The
model copies every one of those habits. The agreed convention:

* a value printed several times appears ONCE, in its proper field, its
  ``page_ref`` listing every page that prints it;
* extra fields hold printed values that have no proper field, one entry per
  label and value, also with every page that prints it;
* a value with its own field is not repeated in the extra fields - the pages
  the extra entry cites go into that field's ``page_ref``.

The rules, each logged as a correction (:func:`apply_label_rules`):

* **page list** - a value's pages become the pages that print it: a page that
  does not is taken out; a document-level value printed on more pages (a policy
  number in every page header) lists them all. A value in a table row keeps to
  the pages it cites: the same amount printed elsewhere may be another row's.
  A name or a phrase keeps every page it cites (it may be printed only in a
  logo), and another page is added only where it heads a line - a header, a
  footer, a "Named Insured: ..." line - not where its words fall in a sentence
  ("as shown in the Policy Declarations").
* **extra field repeats a field** - folded into that field, as above. Only a
  value printed as itself (an identifier, a name, a large amount) that one
  field holds: "$0.00", "$500" or "2015" in two places is not one value. A
  table row's value gains no page this way: a row is listed where its table
  lists it, not where it is mentioned.
* **extra field merged** - the same label and value twice becomes one entry.
* **extra field not a value** - a page counter, a run of prose.
* **extra field moved to its field** - Protection Class and a "Paid By:
  Mortgagee" line, where the proper field is empty (and dropped where it holds
  them already).
* **link names the building** - an entry that applies to a location with one
  building names the building, as the client's own example does (Coverage A
  and the mortgagee of homeowners_minimal.json name ``bldg_1``). The labels
  named such a premises by its location in some seeds and its building in
  others, so the model learned a habit per layout.
* **number not printed** - a location or building number no page prints as
  one ("Location 1", "Property: 1", "Bldg 2", or a "Loc. #" column with the
  number in a cell of its own), never the house number of the street address.
* **printed nowhere** - a value with figures that no page prints, in a field
  or an extra field, is listed, not changed: the corpus build leaves out the
  windows that hold it (``build_jsonl._policy_window_rows``). Deleting the value
  would teach the model to skip a value the page may print in a form the
  search misses.

What is checked against a page's text is only what that text can settle. A
name is never "printed nowhere": it is often only in a logo, which the text
layer does not hold. A page whose text misses figures its label cites settles
nothing: nothing is taken out on its word. Figures are what the check counts -
a text layer can hold every word of a page and none of its amounts (figures
drawn in a font that records no characters, as on one carrier's declarations).
Nor does the OCR text laid invisibly over a scanned page (:func:`scanned_pages`):
it shows where a value is printed, never that one is not - OCR reads "NIP0115"
as "NIPO115" and "$37.47" as "537.47". Every check reads the digital render's
text layer, which a scanned twin shares with its digital twin through their one
gold; a document with no text layer gets only the rules that need no text.
