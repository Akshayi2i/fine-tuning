"""RunPod control — ephemeral training pods and the persistent serving endpoint (SPEC_13 §7).

Two lifetimes, deliberately different (arch §14):

* **Training pods are ephemeral.** A pod clones the repo at a pinned commit,
  works, writes to the staging volume, and terminates. Code is never permanently
  resident on a pod, so "which code produced this model" is answered by the
  manifest rather than by whatever happened to be on a box.
* **The serving endpoint is persistent.** It is updated to a promoted version and
  rolled back, not launched and destroyed.

**Every pod gets the staging volume attached, and a launch without it is refused.**
That check is the whole reason this module owns pod creation rather than each
stage calling the API itself: a pod without the volume writes to pod-local disk,
terminates, and the work is gone — with no error anywhere, because every write
succeeded.

Stages 2, 4 and 5 all want a GPU, so ``finetune`` provisions **one pod for the
whole command** rather than shuttling a corpus between machines: cheaper than
three launches, and it removes two Blob round trips.
