"""The 11 pipeline stages as addressable functions (IMPL-13 §8, arch §13).

``run.py`` composes these; an Airflow DAG or a GitHub Actions workflow could
schedule the same functions unchanged. Keeping them here rather than in the CLI
is what makes ``--from-stage`` a slice of a list instead of a special case in an
argument parser.

Four properties are requirements, not aspirations:

* **Every stage reads and writes Blob or the staging volume, never pod-local disk.**
  A pod is ephemeral; anything written to its own disk is gone at teardown.
* **Every training, evaluation and quantization job writes a run manifest.**
* **Stages are idempotent and resumable.** Re-running a completed stage is a
  no-op, not a duplicate — which is what makes ``--from-stage`` safe to reach for
  after a mid-pipeline failure.
* **Stage 6 is a hard stop.** A candidate that regresses any gating metric does
  not merge, and there is no override path. ``all`` therefore never reaches
  ``package`` on a failed gate.
