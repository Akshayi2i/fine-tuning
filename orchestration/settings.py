"""Loader for ``orchestration/config/pipeline.yaml`` (SPEC_13 §9).

A config file nothing reads is worse than no config file: it documents a policy
the system does not follow. Everything in ``pipeline.yaml`` is loaded here and
used — GPU class per stage, retry policy, and the CLI's own defaults — so
changing a value there changes what runs.

**Secrets are not here.** The file names the environment variables that carry
them; it never carries them itself.
