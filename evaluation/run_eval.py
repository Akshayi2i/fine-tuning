"""The evaluation driver (IMPL-08 §3, arch §8, §15).

Runs a model version over the **frozen golden eval set** through the IMPL-07
inference core, computes every metric, and writes
``eval-reports/v{n}/{doc_type}/report.json`` plus a top-level summary — broken
down per doc type *and* per modality mode.

Four subsets are scored explicitly on top of the full set: ``image_only``,
``scanned``, ``noisy_ocr`` and ``long_policy``. An aggregate hides exactly the
regressions that matter — image-only accuracy can fall ten points while the
overall number moves two, because image-only is a third of the corpus.

**The eval set is frozen and versioned separately**, one per tenant, human
double-verified, and held constant across corpus versions so model versions
compare like with like. :func:`assert_eval_set_disjoint` enforces the part of
that which code can: **no eval ``source_id`` may appear in any of the tenant's
corpus splits.** Train on your eval set and every number in the registry becomes
a measurement of memorisation, with no symptom anywhere — the loss curve looks
fine and the gate passes.

Per-document **error records** are kept, not just aggregates, because
``vit_gate`` (IMPL-06) needs the perception-vs-reasoning split and failure-mode
analysis needs real material.
