"""Latency and GPU memory, measured where a release is evaluated (Fideon SPEC_09 handoff item 6).

Recorded in the eval report and copied into the release bundle; not gated
until SPEC_06 sets a target. Measured during the golden eval, which serves
every eval document through :func:`serving.pipeline.extract` on the target
GPU: the P95 of every generation round - the windows of a policy or a Loss Run
that run together, or a whole short document read in one call - per adapter,
and the most GPU memory in use while the eval ran, sampled every few seconds.

What this is not: a load test with every adapter of every promoted release
loaded at once. The eval serves this release's merged model alone; the bundle
says so (``measured_with``).
