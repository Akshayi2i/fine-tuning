"""The promotion gate (arch v2.1 §15.5).

**Why v1's gate was replaced.** It required the candidate to match or beat the
current release on *every* one of twelve metrics, within a flat tolerance of
0.001, with no override — on the reasoning that a gate which can be waived stops
being a guarantee.

That was right about the risk and wrong about the remedy. At pilot volume the
eval set holds three or four documents per type, so classification accuracy can
only take the values 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0: the tolerance was two hundred and
fifty times finer than the measurement could resolve. With twelve metrics each
needing not to move down, a genuinely-equal model passed all twelve with
probability near 0.5¹² — about 0.02%. And it does not improve at scale: at n=50
the standard error of a proportion is ~0.07, still seventy times the tolerance.

A gate that cannot be passed and cannot be waived is not a strict gate. It is a
rule everyone agrees to ignore, on the afternoon it first blocks something
obviously fine.

**Three conditions replace it**, all of which must hold:

1. **Absolute floors.** Every gating metric meets its §0d floor. This applies to
   the first release too, which has no predecessor — v1's gate passed a first
   version on *zero* measured metrics.
2. **Non-inferiority.** For each metric, the lower bound of the 95% CI on
   (candidate − current), from a paired bootstrap over documents, sits above −δ.
   Per-metric δ, because a 1pp drop in identifier accuracy and a 1pp drop in
   free-text similarity are not the same event.
3. **Improvement.** At least one primary metric improves with its CI lower bound
   above zero — or the release fixes a documented defect. Without this a model
   could pass forever on non-inferiority alone.

**And an override exists**, requiring a named person and a written reason, both
recorded in the gate decision and the release bundle. A waiver nobody can
attribute later is the thing actually worth preventing.
