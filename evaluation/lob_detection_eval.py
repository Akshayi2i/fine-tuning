"""Measure line-of-business detection before it routes production policies.

A policy that reaches L3 with no line can have its line read by the classifier
(``serving.pipeline._resolve_lob``), and routing then trusts that reading: at or
above the line threshold it goes to the line's adapter and schema with no flag.
Nothing measured how often the reading is right - the golden eval always sends
the known line, and the gate's ``lob_detection_accuracy`` scores another field -
so detection ships off (``routing.detect_lob``) until this has been run.

Each frozen policy with one known line is read as serving would read it with no
line and no L1/L2 hint, and resolved by serving's own :func:`_resolve_lob` at
serving's own thresholds, so the numbers are the routing's, not a copy of it.
The classifier is asked once per document; the threshold sweep replays its
answer. Reported: the per-line report against
:data:`~evaluation.metrics.lob_detection.DETECTION_FLOOR`, the confidently-wrong
rate (a wrong line at or above the line threshold: routed with no flag, the
error nobody reviews), how many documents took each routing source, the same
over scanned and native documents and held-out and seen carriers, and a sweep
of both thresholds to fit them from.
