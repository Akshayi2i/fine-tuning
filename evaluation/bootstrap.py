"""Paired bootstrap over documents (arch v2.1 §15.5).

The v1 gate compared two point estimates against a flat tolerance of 0.001 and
blocked on any movement larger than that. At pilot volume the eval set holds
three or four documents per type, so a metric like classification accuracy can
only take the values 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 — the tolerance was **two hundred
and fifty times finer than the measurement could resolve**. And with twelve
metrics each needing to not move down, a genuinely-equal model passed all twelve
with probability near 0.5¹² ≈ 0.02%.

The result was a gate that could not be passed, deliberately built with no
override. That combination does not produce caution; it produces a rule everyone
agrees to ignore.

**What replaces it.** Resample the evaluation DOCUMENTS with replacement, rescore
both models on each resample, and read the distribution of the difference. Paired
because both models saw the same documents — comparing independent samples would
throw away the pairing and widen every interval for nothing.

Two questions, asked separately:

* **Non-inferiority** — is the candidate no worse than the current release by
  more than δ? The lower bound of the 95% CI on (candidate − current) must sit
  above −δ. This is what "did not regress" means when the measurement is noisy.
* **Improvement** — is at least one primary metric actually better? The lower
  bound must sit above zero. Without this a release could pass forever on
  non-inferiority alone, never improving.

Pure standard library. numpy would be faster, but this runs once per gate on a
few hundred documents, and the dependency is not worth the millisecond.
