"""Checkpoint selection by generated field F1 (arch v2.1 §11.2).

**Validation loss does not select what ships.** It is logged, and it drives early
stopping, but it is a poor proxy for extraction accuracy: loss is averaged over
every token the model produces, so it is dominated by the easy copy tokens — the
schema keys, the JSON punctuation, the boilerplate — that the model gets right
from the first hundred steps. A checkpoint can improve on loss while getting
worse at the values, which is the only thing the gate reads.

Field F1 needs **generation**, and the training loop's own eval does not generate
efficiently for a VLM. So selection is a separate job, run after training:

    last 3 checkpoints + the best-loss checkpoint
        -> generate on the validation split through vLLM
        -> score field F1 with the same code the gate uses
        -> the winner is what gets merged

**Checkpoints are loaded as a decoder LoRA, not merged.** vLLM applies one LoRA
per request, which is exactly enough for this — a per-checkpoint merge would cost
~16GB of disk and several minutes each, to answer a question that does not need
the weights folded in.

The candidate set is small on purpose. Scoring every checkpoint would multiply
the cost by the epoch count for a decision that, in practice, sits between the
last few and the one early stopping liked.

**On a pod with several GPUs the candidates are scored at once**, one worker
process and vLLM engine per GPU (:class:`ParallelScorer`), each with the engine
the in-process scorer uses; only how many run at a time changes. One engine on
one card took ~35 minutes a candidate on the smoke set, ~2.5 hours for four,
with three of four GPUs idle.
