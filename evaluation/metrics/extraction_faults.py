"""False nulls, hallucinations and page-selection recall (arch v2.1 §15.2).

Three gating metrics that share a shape — each counts a specific way an
extraction can be wrong that **field accuracy cannot see** — and that is why they
are separate metrics rather than folded into one number.

* **False null.** The value is on the page and the model emitted ``null``. An
  aggregate field score counts this as one miss among many, but it is the failure
  mode that quietly halves a form's usefulness while looking like ordinary
  imperfection. It also produces no low-confidence signal: a null has no tokens
  to be uncertain about, so §5 confidence is blind to it and only this metric
  sees it.

* **Hallucination.** A value was emitted that appears nowhere in the document. A
  fluent, plausible, invented policy number scores as one wrong field — but a
  wrong value is worse than an absent one, because an absent one gets reviewed
  and a confident wrong one gets used.

* **Page-selection recall.** For routed policies: a field-bearing page the
  selector did not choose. The extraction that follows cannot be right about a
  page it never saw, so this caps everything downstream of it — and it fails
  silently, because the extraction looks complete against the pages it did get.
