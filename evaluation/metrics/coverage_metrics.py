"""LoB accuracy, schema validity, calibration error, and mode accuracy (arch §15).

Four metrics that share a shape — each aggregates per-document outcomes into one
number the promotion gate reads — but each answers a different question:

* **LoB accuracy**, reported **per value**, never folded into overall field
  accuracy: a class that is rare in the corpus must not hide inside a healthy
  aggregate (arch §0b).
* **Schema validity**, which mirrors the Fideon SPEC_07 Stage 3 audit gate.
* **ECE**, which asks whether the confidence numbers are trustworthy — not
  whether the extractions are.
* **Mode accuracy**, split by ``image_only`` and ``scanned``, which feeds the ViT
  escalation gate. It also classifies errors, because that gate keys on the
  perception-vs-reasoning distinction rather than on the accuracy number.
