"""The ceiling reading a policy in windows puts on accuracy (the oracle merge).

Each document's GOLD label is sliced into its windows exactly as the dataset
build slices it (``policy_windows.window_target``), the slices are merged by the
serving merge (``serving.policy_merge``), and the result is compared with the
gold label as scoring uses it (``common.canonical.schema_label``). A perfect
model reproduces exactly those slices, so whatever this loses no model can win
back. Reported by scripts/diagnose_windowing.py and in the golden eval report.

Lost values get a reason: ``no_page_ref`` (no page recorded, group read over
several windows), ``unread_page`` (printed only on pages no window of its group
reads), ``row_unmatched`` (its row came back split or keyless) or ``merge``.
Values outside the schema are counted apart: no model can write them.
