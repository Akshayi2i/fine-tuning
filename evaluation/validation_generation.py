"""Generate over the validation split once, and read it three ways (arch v2.1 §8.2, §11.2, §5.3).

Checkpoint selection, calibration and the promotion gate all need the same
thing: the model's own generations over validation documents, scored against
their golden labels. Three separate generators would mean three definitions of
"correct", and a selector that scores by one definition picks a checkpoint the
gate, scoring by another, rejects. So there is one generator here and three
readers:

* :func:`score_generations` — the gate's metrics, through
  :func:`evaluation.run_eval.build_report`. Checkpoint selection reads its
  ``field_normalized_match``.
* :func:`calibration_samples` — ``(features, correct)`` per field, split into the
  calibration and threshold halves the dataset build stamped on each row.
* :func:`vllm_scorer` in :mod:`evaluation.checkpoint_eval` — the first reader
  applied per checkpoint, with the checkpoint as a decoder LoRA.

The prompt is the row's own ``messages`` with the assistant turn removed, so the
model sees exactly what training rendered for that document (arch §7).
