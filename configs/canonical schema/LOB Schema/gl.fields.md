# gl - core fields (SPEC_21 4.3)

Core field list of the gl (commercial general liability) SPEC_21 schema. Seed golds are not signed off yet,
so the list is built from what the line's real CGL documents print -- 49 documents of 10 carriers under
`synth_core/fideon/synth_core/data/source data/<Carrier>/cgl/` and, from 1.1.0, 50 CGL documents of 10
carrier folders of the `policy_CGL` corpus (`policy_CGL/<Carrier>/CGL/`), read in place (text layer, first 8
pages of a seed, first 20 of a `policy_CGL` document, whose CGL declarations can follow a long renewal packet) -- every field of the pre-SPEC_21 `gl.json` 1.5.0 (`gl.crosswalk.yaml`) and the line's L1 registry YAMLs.
One file of the seed folder (Chubb's) is a personal excess liability policy and is not counted. Of `policy_CGL`,
the Businessowners (Coterie `dec_01`), professional liability (Coterie `dec_02`/`renewal_01`, Coterie Insurance
`dec_02`) and D&O (Philadelphia `policy_01`) policies, paperwork (invoices, notices, letters), text-less scans and the
unreadable XS Broker `policy_02` are not counted. Carriers marked `(policy_CGL)` are carrier or broker folders of that corpus.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Schema | `gl.json` 3.0.0, composing `common_model.json` 1.1.0 by `$ref` |
| Core leaves | 172 (budget 80-300; `python -m fideon.synth_core.tools leaves`) |
| Leaves whose label the documents print | 97 of the 172 |
| Documents | 105 CGL documents: 49 seed documents of 10 carriers and 56 `policy_CGL` documents of 13 folders (FORTEGRA, Great American, Hiscox, Indium, Johnson & Johnson, Liberty Mutual, McNeil & Company, Philadelphia Insurance Companies, Russell Bond, XS Broker; from 1.2.0 The Main Street America Group, Scottsdale Insurance Company, USLI, and a Utica First renewal). Seed carriers: Diamond State Insurance Company, Gemini Insurance Company, Great American Insurance Company, Security Mutual Insurance Company, Sutton National, Third Coast Insurance Company, Travelers, USLI, Utica First Insurance Company, Western World Insurance Group |
| Blocks besides the envelope | `locations`, `rating_exposures`, `claims_made_terms`, `countersignature` |
| LOB block | none (the 1.1.0-1.2.0 `gl` block was removed in 2.0.0; its concepts are common-model fields from 3.0.0, see below) |
| Coverage codes | 18 (`gl.coverage_codes.yaml`), of them 6 shared `X_` codes |
| Mandatory fields | `carrier.name`, `named_insured.primary_name`, `policy.policy_number`, `policy.effective_date`, `policy.expiration_date`, `coverages[].limits[].amount` |

Field names, meanings and shapes are fixed by the common model; this line chooses the blocks, the coverage
codes and the printed labels below. **Printed labels (this line)** are captions the CGL documents print
beside or above the value that the common model does not already list; they are the schema's `fideon:aliases`
for the field. **Carriers** lists the carriers whose documents print any label of the field (this line's or
the common model's) in their first 8 pages: a label scan, not a gold count -- a carrier listed prints the
caption, which says nothing about whether every document of it fills the field. One-word labels of under six
letters are left out of the scan (they match running text), and an address part counts its address's caption.
Coverage names and limit
captions are aliases of the coverage codes, not of `coverages[].coverage_name`, and are listed in the
coverage codes file.

**Endorsement-coverages.** Additional insured, primary and noncontributory, waiver of subrogation, coverage
extension and snow plow operations are coverages granted by an endorsement. Each endorsement is one `coverages[]`
entry: `coverage_name` is the form's printed title and `form_refs` its form number as printed in
`forms_and_endorsements[].form_number` (three additional-insured forms are three entries). They usually carry no
limit, which the mandatory field and rule 5 allow: both mean that at least one coverage of the document has a limit
amount.

There is no LOB block (SPEC_21 v0.9 4.2.4). Three concepts the CGL documents print needed a field in an existing
common block, and common model 1.1.0 added them (3.0.0 uses them):
- the products-completed operations rate and premium of each classification (CR-GL-02). An ISO premium schedule
  prints `Pr/Co` and `All Other` columns per classification: each column is one `rating_exposures[]` row with the
  same `class_code`, `class_description` and `location_ref`, `rating_component` `products_completed_operations` or
  `premises_operations`, and that column's `rate` and `premium`. A classification with one rate has one row and
  no `rating_component`;
- the minimum earned premium as a percentage, `premium.minimum_earned_percent` (CR-GL-12). An amount stays in
  `premium.minimum_earned`;
- the carrier's financial rating, `carrier.financial_rating` (CR-GL-12).

gl 1.1.0-1.2.0 held them in a `gl` block and 2.0.0 in `additional_fields`. The additional insured, primary and
noncontributory and waiver of subrogation codes are the shared `X_` codes from 3.0.0 (CR-GL-03).

`rating_modifiers` (listed for gl in `lob_schema_map.yaml`) is not composed: none of the documents prints an
IRPM, schedule-rating or experience factor. `claims_made_terms` is composed although the map does not list it:
the legacy schema carries claims-made provisions and a CGL claims-made coverage part prints a retroactive date
(Gemini's declarations do).
