"""Second review of the common-model training targets and the model view.

A fragment of a coverage row is left out of a window only when nothing is lost
by it: every value it holds is taught elsewhere. A coverage split at a window
boundary - its name at the foot of one page, its amounts at the top of the
next - was taught in no window at all, and serving then gave its row another
vehicle's amounts. And an umbrella's underlying policy codes another line's
coverages in its limits as well as in its own code.
