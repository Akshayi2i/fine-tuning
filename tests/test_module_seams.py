"""Seam tests — what one module emits is what the next module reads.

Every one of the 34 findings from the full-tree review lived at a boundary
between two modules, and the suite stayed green throughout because each module
was tested against a hand-written fixture rather than against what its
neighbour actually produces. Three of those tests passed *because* they encoded
the bug they were meant to guard.

A unit test proves a module is self-consistent. Only a test that runs both
sides proves they agree. Nothing here constructs the data under test by hand.
