"""The lines that stay on self-contained schema files render exactly as frozen.

The common-model work (SPEC_21) changes code every policy runs through - the
schema registry, the model view, the templates, the section map, the target
builder. None of it may change what a self-contained line, ACORD form or Loss
Run renders: those prompts are what their adapters train and serve on.
