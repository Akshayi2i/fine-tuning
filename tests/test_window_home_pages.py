"""A coverage row is taught on the windows that show its home: where its name
or a figure of its own is printed.

A label lists every page that prints a value, and a limit's caption ("Each
Occurrence Limit") or the word "Included" is printed throughout policy wording
too. A GL schedule names no coverage, so its table has no printed identifier
and the orphan rule never runs: a window of wording was taught a coverage row
holding only that caption, and the smoke-trained model wrote coverages from
wording - or learned that schedules hold rows a page does not show.
