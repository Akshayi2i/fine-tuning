"""SPEC_08 §3 and SPEC_11 §1 — the eval driver and the serving endpoint.

The two assertions here guard failures that leave no trace anywhere else.

**Eval-set leakage.** Train on the eval set and every number in the registry
becomes a measurement of memorisation: the loss curve looks healthy, the metrics
improve, and the promotion gate passes. Nothing in the pipeline says otherwise.

**PII in a serving log.** A handler that logs its request for debugging has
exported every name, TIN and address in the document, and it does so silently and
continuously rather than once.
