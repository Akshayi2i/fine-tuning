"""The two name grammars: ``source_id`` and ``run_id``.

Both are join keys — a source_id ties a prediction back to its page, a run_id
ties an artifact back to the run that made it — so both fail in the same way:
silently, by resolving to something that matches nothing, long after the write.

These cover the two rules that make scoped runs possible at all:

* reading a name is not minting one (a paused document type stays readable), and
* one parser, so the id a trainer writes is the id the gate can reconstruct.
