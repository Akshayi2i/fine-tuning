"""Scoring a common-model line: what the second review found the report still got wrong.

The first fixes paired a coverage with a wrong code on its printed name, but
only after the code had been tried, and only while the coverage kept its link
to its vehicle. A wrong code is most often a sibling coverage's, which took that
sibling's row; and a policy whose vehicles and coverages fall in different
windows is served with every link lost (tests/test_schema2_serving.py), so its
coverages paired on the code in table order. Each test below scores an answer
served by replaying its training targets, or the fixture itself, and checks
that one misread value costs that value, in every metric that reads it.
