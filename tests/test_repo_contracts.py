"""Repo-level contracts (IMPL-01 §§11-14, IMPL-03, IMPL-12).

The checks nothing else covers because they are about the repository rather than
a module: the config files carrying every parameter the architecture specifies,
``.env.example`` naming every variable the code reads, and the provenance record
that ties an extraction result back to the run that produced it.

The env-var check is here because its absence already cost something: the
``ALLOW_EXTERNAL_PREANNOTATION`` guard was documented in ``.env.example`` and
read by no module, so the compliance refusal it describes did not exist. A
documented variable nobody reads and a read variable nobody documents are the
same class of bug in opposite directions, and both are caught below.
