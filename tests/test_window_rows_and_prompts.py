"""What a window is taught and told (accuracy plan, stage 2): a coverage's form
numbers only where its pages print them, and the window prompt's rules.

A training row teaches exactly what its target shows against what its prompt
says. A form number in the target of a window that does not show it is a value
to invent; a prompt that calls form numbers unprinted, or never says which
values other windows read, contradicts the targets it is trained with.
