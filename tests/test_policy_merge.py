"""serving.policy_merge — one canonical document from a policy's section windows.

A long policy is read as a cross product of section groups and page windows, so
the same value can come back from several windows. These tests pin the merge
rules that turn those partial answers into one document without a model in the
loop, and that keep each value's confidence evidence attached to it.
