"""IMPL-02 §3 — the path-aware push/pull helpers.

These exist so no caller ever hand-builds a Blob path. That is not tidiness: the
only place that did build them inline published a Foundation run against the
`doc_type=None` "unified" merged and quantized paths, which exist only under
`--foundation-only`, so the manifest pointed at artifacts nobody had built.
