"""Review findings on the common-model training targets and the model view.

A window target is what the model is taught to write, and the model view is
the grammar it is held to when it writes. The two must agree on every gold the
client's schema accepts: a reference the slice leaves out is left out of the
target too; the view encodes no client rule a window cannot satisfy; a code
field takes the codes its value can really hold; a label is one part of its own
line; and a fragment of a row is taught only in a window that shows what
identifies it.
