"""``RunManifest`` — the lineage record for every training run (arch §12).

One manifest per run, Foundation and per-type alike, no exceptions. It is the
single record linking *code version + data version + config + resulting metrics
+ artifact location*, and without it these questions have no answer:

* which corpus version produced ``lossrun-adapter-v2.1``?
* why did ACORD accuracy drop between v2 and v3?
* which adapters depend on ``foundation-v2.0`` and must be re-validated now that
  Foundation has moved?

The manifest is written **even when the weights are only staged** on the RunPod
volume, because a volume is working storage with no durability guarantee. Without
that rule, a reclaimed volume means a training run that happened and left no
trace (master §12a).
