"""Per-line synthetic fraction and scanned share of a scope's training set
(Fideon SPEC_09 amendment items 6 and 7).

The corpus is built once and every scope reads a view of it
(:mod:`training.corpus_view`), so the shares are applied where a scope reads
it: the view keeps, line by line, every real document and the synthetic ones
that bring the line to its configured shares. Verified real golds always
train. Validation and test are never sampled.

Configured in the scope's training config::

    data_mix:
      synthetic_fraction: 0.8   # synthetic share of a line's train documents
      scanned_share: null       # scanned share of a line's train documents
      lines:                    # per line, over the scope defaults above
        homeowners: {scanned_share: 0.4}

``null`` or absent leaves a share unsteered. With neither share set, every
document trains, as before these settings existed. Counted in documents, as
``line_balance`` counts them: a long policy has many rows and is one example.

The input-mode mix (50% OCR text and images, 20% corrupted OCR and images, 30%
images only) is a separate setting: :data:`common.constants.MODALITY_MIX` is
the global default, and a scope's config may override it with
``modality_mix:``. Modes are drawn when the corpus is built, so the corpus
records the mix it was drawn with and a run whose scope wants another is
refused (:func:`assert_corpus_mix`).
