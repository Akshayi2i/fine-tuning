"""The unified extractor LoRA (arch v2.1 §4.1, §9, §10).

A **thin wrapper**: it assembles an ms-swift configuration and launches it. The
training loop is ms-swift's own ``Seq2SeqTrainer``, built on the Hugging Face
Transformers ``Trainer`` — this file deliberately contains no optimizer step, no
backward pass and no collator (arch v2.1 §10).

*(TRL is installed as an ms-swift dependency for its RLHF trainers. It is not the
SFT loop used here — the v1 documentation said it was, and that was wrong.)*

**One run, not four.** v1 trained a Foundation LoRA and then a per-type LoRA for
each document type, stacked on top. That topology is unservable: vLLM applies one
LoRA per request, so the two could never both be active. It also did not fit the
data — at 25-30 documents per type a rank-16 adapter memorises its own training
set. So: one adapter, every document type, every task, conditioned by the prompt.

What this file owns is the policy the trainer cannot enforce for itself:

* **ViT and mergers frozen.** ``freeze_vit`` and ``freeze_aligner``, and the
  merger is not a LoRA target. Arbitration is learned in the decoder, where image
  tokens and OCR text tokens attend to each other; the mergers never see OCR text.
* **One max_length across a mixed-task corpus**, taken from the largest task cap,
  because ms-swift takes a single value and the corpus interleaves a 4k classify
  example with a 32k policy extraction.
* **A manifest written before launch**, so a pod that dies at step 40 leaves a
  record rather than nothing.
