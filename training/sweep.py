"""The bounded 3-phase hyperparameter sweep (SPEC_06 §6, arch §11a).

Bounded is the whole design. An unbounded search over learning rate × epochs ×
rank is 27 runs before it has told you anything; this is ~9–12, ordered so each
phase is conditioned on the previous winner:

===========  ==================================  ====================  ==========
phase        sweeps                              metric                budget
===========  ==================================  ====================  ==========
1 · lr       highest impact, so it runs first    validation loss       3 / type
2 · epochs   with the Phase 1 winner fixed       validation field F1   3 / type
3 · rank     **only if F1 plateaus** after 1–2   validation field F1   3
===========  ==================================  ====================  ==========

**Phase 2 changes metric on purpose.** Validation loss can fall while field
extraction gets worse — the model becomes more confident about a distribution
that is not the one being scored — and field F1 is what the promotion gate reads.
Selecting epochs on loss would optimise a proxy for the thing that matters.

**Every candidate writes a full run manifest** with ``is_sweep_run: true``. Sweep
runs are first-class registry entries, not untracked side experiments: a config
promoted to production has to be traceable to the run that justified it, and
"we tried a few and this looked best" is not traceable.

**When to run it.** After the SPEC_15 pilot passes, before the first production
run. Sweeping against 25–30 documents per type measures noise: the test split is
3–4 documents, and the accuracy difference between 1e-4 and 2e-4 is smaller than
the variance from which documents landed in it. :func:`assert_enough_data` makes
that a refusal rather than a footnote.
