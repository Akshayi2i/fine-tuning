"""The ViT escalation gate (arch §3) — decide, don't act.

The Vision Encoder is frozen by default. Unfreezing costs a full Foundation
retrain and risks degrading the pretrained document/OCR capability that the
image-only pathway depends on, so it happens only when the evidence says visual
*reading* is genuinely the bottleneck.

The gate fires when:

1. image-only OR scanned accuracy is below target, **and**
2. the errors are **perception** errors (misread characters, missed checkboxes)
   rather than **schema/reasoning** errors (right value, wrong field).

Condition 2 is the load-bearing one. If the model reads a character correctly but
puts it in the wrong JSON field, that is an LLM or projector problem and touching
the ViT will not help — it will just cost a retrain.

**Three outcomes, not two.** ``insufficient_data`` exists because at pilot volume
image-only carries roughly nine documents of signal per type, and thin data
produces exactly the perception-shaped errors this gate keys on. Forcing a
fire/no-fire answer there would buy an expensive retrain to fix a problem more
documents would have solved. The architecture says the gate must not fire on
pilot data (arch §16c); this is how the code expresses that rather than relying
on someone remembering.
