"""Which canonical sections one extraction call asks for (``configs/schema_sections.yaml``).

A canonical policy schema does not fit in a prompt alongside the pages it
describes. This module cuts it into named slices — ``decl``, ``arrays``,
``lineblk``, ``dtd`` — so a window's prompt describes only what that window can
answer, and so a window has room for seven or eight pages instead of four.

**A slice is a pure function of (lob, group).** No gold, no page list, no
document. That is the property serving depends on: it has no label to consult,
so anything derived from one cannot be reproduced at inference time, and a
training row whose shape cannot be reproduced is a row that teaches a shape the
model will never be asked for again.

The group a section belongs to is declared. The *pages* a group reads are
computed — from the routed set and, for the declarations group, from where the
declarations were actually found.
