"""Prompt rendering — the single renderer used by every stage.

Corpus build (IMPL-05), evaluation (IMPL-08), serving (IMPL-11) and testing
(IMPL-12) all render prompts through :func:`render_system_prompt`. There is
deliberately no second path.

Why that matters: the system prompt is the conditioning input on every training
row *and* every production request. If the two ever diverge — by a character —
the fine-tuned model degrades at serving time, and **nothing in the training
metrics shows it**, because training never sees the serving prompt (arch §7).
``test_prompt_parity`` asserts the equality this module exists to provide.

The rendered prompt carries each field's ``description``: a semantic gloss with
exclusions, which is how the model maps an unseen surface label onto a canonical
key (arch §0c). It carries **no alias list** — see the template header for why.
