"""Schema registry — load, resolve, and validate against the canonical schemas.

The schemas in ``schemas/`` are the Fideon SPEC_00 canonical models serialised to
JSON Schema (master §1.1). They are the training target *and* the inference
output contract, so this module is the single place they get loaded.

Two things here are load-bearing rather than incidental:

``$ref`` resolution
    ``common_fields.json`` and ``lob.enum.json`` hold definitions shared across
    document types. Defining a field per-schema instead would let two
    definitions of the same canonical field drift apart, and no test would catch
    it because each schema still validates on its own (IMPL-01).

Field descriptions
    Every field carries a ``description`` — a semantic gloss with exclusions.
    These are **prompt text**: they are injected into the system prompt at
    corpus-build and inference time, so they are part of what the model trains
    on (arch §0c). :func:`assert_all_fields_described` enforces their presence.

    Two families of schema live behind one interface, and they differ in three
    ways that each cause a silent failure if assumed away:

    ``inline_refs``
        The schemas in ``schemas/`` ``$ref`` *other files* (``common_fields.json``),
        which the model cannot follow, so they are inlined into the prompt. The
        canonical schemas ``$ref`` only their own ``#/$defs/FieldValue`` — once
        per leaf, 532 times in homeowners. Inlining that turns a 41,955-character
        file into 281,355 characters of identical repeated envelope, which is
        ~70k tokens of prompt saying one thing over and over.

    ``version_at``
        ``schemas/`` declares a top-level ``version``. The canonical files carry
        theirs at ``fideon:source.version``. :func:`schema_version` is called for
        every registered schema when a corpus manifest is written, so a wrong
        path here fails every build rather than one call.

    ``strip_prefixes``
        Key prefixes dropped before the schema reaches the model. The canonical
        files carry ``fideon:aliases`` — the printed labels carriers use for each
        field. Those must never reach a prompt (master §1.4): a model handed a
        lookup table never learns the semantics, and the first unseen label
        produces a miss with no signal that anything went wrong.

    ``common_model``
        A SPEC_21 line overlay: a thin file whose blocks ``$ref`` the common
        model in another file. Loaded as a bundle (:func:`_bundle`), so every
        reader still gets one self-contained schema. The self-contained line
