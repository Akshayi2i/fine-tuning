"""Training scopes — WHAT one run covers (arch v2.1 §4.1, §4.2).

A scope names a training run's coverage: which document types it trains, which
tasks its corpus carries, and which document types a release from it may serve.
Each scope is an **independent LoRA on the bf16 base** with its own run id,
checkpoints, merge, quantization, calibration, gate and release bundle. Scopes
are never stacked — vLLM applies one LoRA per request, the same constraint that
made v1's Foundation-plus-per-type topology unservable.

**Why a named scope rather than a bare ``--doc-types`` list.** The name is the
addressing key: it is the run-id lineage and the artifact path segment. Two
different runs over the same type set (a policy run with windowed tasks and one
without) need different names, and a list cannot give them one. A list also
carries no floors and no task set, so the gate would have nothing scope-specific
to read.

**The unified scope keeps the lineage ``extractor``**, so every artifact already
in Blob stays addressable and every unified path renders byte-identically. That
is the compatibility pin the whole design rests on.

**Not-applicable is derived, never simply trusted.** ``CONDITIONAL_METRICS`` in
:mod:`evaluation.gating` already carries a warning that it is a loophole if
widened casually. A scope may declare a metric not applicable only if the
scope's own *shape* implies it — see :func:`structural_not_applicable`. Without
that rule, "configure a scope" would become "waive a gate".
