"""The client's canonical ``FieldValue`` JSON, and the two shapes around it.

Every policy is extracted into the client's canonical schema
(``configs/canonical schema/LOB Schema``), where each leaf is an envelope::

    {"raw": "04/01/2026", "parsed": "04/01/2026",
     "confidence": {"score": 0.97, "source": "vlm"}, "page_ref": [1], "flagged": false}

Three shapes of one document meet here, and this module is the only place that
converts between them:

**Canonical** — the client's contract, what the endpoint returns and what a
golden label is written in. Validated against the client's file byte for byte.

**Model form** — what the model writes: the same tree, each leaf narrowed to
``raw``/``parsed``/``page_ref``, and **sparse** — a field the document does not
state is omitted rather than written as an envelope of nulls. Sparse is not a
style choice: homeowners declares 532 leaves, and an envelope for each is some
twenty thousand output tokens before the first value. ``confidence`` and
``flagged`` are never the model's to write; the pipeline fills them from the
calibrated logprobs and the review thresholds.

**Values view** — each envelope collapsed to its ``parsed`` value (``raw`` when
nothing was parsed). Calibration features, row completeness and field scoring
all read values, and reading them off this view means none of them had to learn
what an envelope is.
