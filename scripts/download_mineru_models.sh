# of opendatalab/PDF-Extract-Kit-1.0: its main branch moves on with MinerU, and
# on 2025-10-24 it deleted files MinerU 1.x loaded - a pod set up after such a
# change downloads fine and fails at the first page, or reads with other weights.
# MinerU's downloader also fetches a config template from its master branch; this
# script writes the config itself (data_pipeline.ocr.mineru_config --write).
# The weights go to HF_HOME (on the volume), the config to MINERU_TOOLS_CONFIG_JSON
# (on the volume), with model-source local: nothing is fetched at OCR time.
