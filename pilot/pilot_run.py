"""Experiment C — the pilot training run (SPEC_15 §3, arch §16c).

25–30 annotated documents per type, pilot split ratios (~70/18/12), Foundation
plus per-type adapters, evaluated on the held-out pilot test split.

This is the **minimum experiment that tests the architecture's generalisation
claim**. Experiments A and B cannot: A uses no fine-tuning, and B evaluates on
the training set by design.

Two properties of these numbers matter more than the numbers:

* **They are directional.** At three or four test documents per type, no single
  metric is trustworthy alone. The batch's real job is proving the pipeline works
  end to end before annotation scales to 1000+/type.
* **A failed criterion is a diagnosis, not a verdict.** Each one maps to a
  specific place to look, and every one of those places is a corpus or config
  problem before it is an architecture problem.

**Alias generalization is the one criterion no plumbing test can stand in for.**
It is measured by deliberate hold-out: pick one surface label per
confusable-prone field, keep every document using it out of ``train``, and put
them in the test split. Scoring well on them means the model learned the semantic
mapping rather than memorising label strings — which is the entire claim of the
canonical-field design (master §1.4).
